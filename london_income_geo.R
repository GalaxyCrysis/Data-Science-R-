#first Im interested in the income so lets get the median income
#since the data are not numeric we first have to convert them
boroughs<- sapply(boroughs, as.numeric)
print(median(boroughs$V42))

#map spatial data
#first we have to join both dataframes london and boroughs
#we look if the boroughs are the same in both datasets
print(london$name %in% boroughs$V2)
#after that we have to rename the colum name of v2 to name
boroughs <- rename(boroughs, name = V2)

#now we can use the dplyr method left_join to join both datasets
london@data <- left_join(london@data, boroughs)

#now we can look a the map with qtm function from tmap
qtm(london, "V42")

#now we wanna see the boroughs where income is > 40000
selection <- boroughs$V42 > 40000
#now plot
